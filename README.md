# CIFAR10 Image Classification and CNN
<b>Brief:</b>

You will develop an interactive Python notebook including the following:
(A)	Exploratory Data Analysis and Preprocessing: Carry out a concise EDA to familiarise yourself with the CIFAR-10 dataset. Some questions to answer are:
1. Dataset Overview
•	What is the shape of the training and testing datasets?
•	What are the data types of the images and labels?
•	How many classes are present in the dataset? What are their names?
2. Distribution of Classes
•	What is the distribution of samples across the classes? Are the classes balanced or imbalanced?
3. Image Properties
•	What is the size (dimensions) of each image?
•	What is the range of pixel values in the images? Are they normalized (e.g., 0-1 or 0-255)?
4. Visualization
•	Can we visualize a few random images from each class to understand their features?
•	What do these images tell us about the variation within and between classes?

(B)	Test at least one clustering algorithm such as K-means. Reduce the dimensionality of the dataset using PCA before performing the clustering. 

(C)	Split the dataset into training and testing set. Implement a classification model based on each one of the following techniques
a.	Decision tree
b.	Random forest
c.	SVM
d.	Research and implement another method such as (but not limited to)  k-Nearest Neighbours or XGBoost.
Provide detailed explanations, evaluations, and comments on the outputs of each model, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of machine learning concepts.

(D)	Neural Networks: 
a.	implement and compare the performance of a shallow network and a suitable CNN
b.	Research and implement a pre-trained model such as (but not limited to) ImageNet

(E)	Hyperparameter Optimization: Select one model and demonstrate the possibility of further improving its performance using hyperparameter optimization techniques.

(F)	Results Summary and Discussion: Provide a written and visual summary of the results obtained from the model evaluations. Clearly present the performance metrics and any insights gained from the analysis.

(G)	References: the key decisions in previous sections must be supported by evidence from the literature. Include primary research and relevant case studies.
